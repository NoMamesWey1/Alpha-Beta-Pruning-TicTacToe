# Tic-Tac-Toe with Alpha-Beta Pruning

This is a Python implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game using the Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization technique in the Minimax algorithm.

## Problem Statement

The task is to design a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the computer player uses the Alpha-Beta Pruning technique to make optimal moves. The Alpha-Beta Pruning is a modification of the minimax algorithm, which helps reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree.

## Concepts

This project focuses on the following concepts:
- Alpha-Beta Pruning: An optimization technique used in the minimax algorithm to minimize the number of evaluated nodes in the search tree.
- Minimax Algorithm: A recursive algorithm used to determine the optimal move for a player in a zero-sum game.

## Task Description

Your task is to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python using object-oriented programming principles and incorporating the Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization technique in the Minimax algorithm. The game should follow the standard rules of Tic-Tac-Toe on a 3x3 matrix.

### Instructions

Follow these instructions while implementing the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

1. Implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python.
2. Use object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to structure your code.
3. Modularize your code into appropriate classes and functions for better organization.
4. Handle error inputs gracefully using exception handling. Ensure that your code can handle invalid user inputs and respond appropriately.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Tic-Tac-Toe game:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred Python development environment.
3. Run the main Python script to start the game.
