# Alpha-Beta-Pruning-TicTacToe

Problem Statement:  Design a Tic-Tac-Toe by making use of Alpha-Beta Pruning
Concepts: Alpha-Beta Pruning, Minimax Algorithm

Task Description: Alpha-beta pruning is a modified version of the minimax algorithm. It is an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm. Your task is to create a Tic-Tac-Toe (3x3 matrix) which uses Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization technique in the Minimax algorithm. 

Your tasks/Instructions:
●	Implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python
●	Follow OOPS Programming style
●	Your code should be structured and modularized
●	Your code should be able to handle error inputs: Exception Handling
